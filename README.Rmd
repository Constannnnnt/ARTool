ARTool is an R package implementing the Aligned Rank Transform for conducting nonparametric analyses of variance on factorial models. This implementation is based on the ART procedure as used in the original implementation of [ARTool](http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/art/) by Wobbrock et al. 

__Note__: The documentation of this package assumes some level of familiarity with when and why you may want to use the aligned rank transform; the [ARTool page](http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/art/) provides a more in-depth (and highly approachable) introduction to the aligned rank transform and the motivation for its use.

## Installation

You can install the latest released version from CRAN with this R command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ARTool")
```

__Or__, you can install the latest development version from GitHub with these R commands: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mjskay/ARTool")
```

## Example

The general approach to using ART is to transform your data using `art`, verify the ART procedure is appropriate to the dataset using `summary`, and then run an anova on the transformed data using `anova`.

First, let us load some example data:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ARTool)
data(Higgins1990Table5)
```

`Higgins1990Table5` is a data frame from an experiment in which the effects of `Moisture` and `Fertilizer` on `DryMatter` in peat pots was tested. Four pots were placed on each `Tray`, with `Moisture` varied between `Tray`s and `Fertilizer` varied within `Tray`s. We can see the basic structure of the data:

```{r}
str(Higgins1990Table5)
head(Higgins1990Table5, n=8)
```

To analyze this data using the aligned rank transform, we first transform the data using `art`. We specify the response variable (`DryMatter`), the fixed effects and all of their interactions (`Moisture*Fertilizer`, or equivalently `Moisture + Fertilizer + Moisture:Fertilizer`), and any grouping terms if present (here, `(1|Tray)`):

```{r}
m <- art(DryMatter ~ Moisture*Fertilizer + (1|Tray), data=Higgins1990Table5)
```

To verify that the ART procedure was correctly applied and is appropriate for this dataset, we can look at the output of `summary`:

```{r}
summary(m)
```

We see that the columns sums of aligned responses and the F values of ANOVAs on aligned responses not of interest are all ~0, indicating that the alignment correctly "stripped out" effects not of interest. Thus, we can apply the ANOVA on the transformed data:

```{r}
anova(m)
```

## Problems
